This project aims to predict the age and gender of a person using deep learning techniques applied to facial images. It uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect facial features and classify both age group and gender with reasonable accuracy.

🔍 Features
Detects human faces in real-time or static images using OpenCV.

Predicts gender (Male/Female).

Predicts age range (e.g., 0–2, 4–6, 8–12, ..., 60+).

Supports webcam/live video feed for real-time predictions.
